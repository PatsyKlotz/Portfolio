      <h2>Where I Started and How I Came to Learn Web Development</h2>
      <p>I have worked for years as a technical writer. Spending many years with Altera Corporation, which has recently been purchased by Intel Corporation. I enjoyed my experiences with Altera and grew to enjoy working with electrical engineers. Knowing next-to-nothing about electrical engineering prior to joining the company, I took classes at UC Santa Cruz. Additionally, I spent many hours with Altera engineers to help me understand class assignments as well as to intrepret their work.</p>
      <p>Deciding that I would like to go back to school and learn someting new, I perused the University of Washington's Professional and Continuing Education website and chose the HTML5/CSS3/Javascript certificate. So far, I have really enjoyed the classes and found the challenge to be just right!</p>
